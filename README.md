# UltraSonic

UltraSonic is a tModLoader 1.4.4 mod that uses the YoutubeExplode and FFmpeg libraries to revolutionise the user's musical experience.

It provides an ingame interface for downloading songs from youtube and then assigning them to bosses, biomes, and other ingame situations, which allows for an extremely wide array of customisation.
